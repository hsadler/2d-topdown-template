REFINEMENTS:

- make zoom zoom on mouse hover location
- make camera move on touch to edge of viewport
- give entities a "drag" state, where they've not yet been moved and validation can be performed
- fix entity->inventory sorting layers do be only when "dragging" state
- add numbers to inventory for quick inventory selection and placement


MAYBE:

- variable game speed (tick system)
- game speed controls
- pause
